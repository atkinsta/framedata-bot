# framedata-bot
Reddit bot to retrieve Tekken 7 frame data.

Many thanks to rbnorway.org for compiling the frame data for Tekken. This bot simply links to their excellent work so they deserve all the credit. 

Currently it only supports the !frames command followed by a characters name. 

Example of usage:

!frames Bryan

!frames Bob

!frames Nina


I hope to add more useful features in the future.
